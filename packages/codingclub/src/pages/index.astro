        <h2>Why learn to code?</h2>
        <p>
          Teaching kids how to code is crucial in today's digital age as it prepares kids for a future where technology plays a central role.

          Coding is not just about understanding computers; it's a way to nurture problem-solving skills, logical thinking, and creativity. When children learn to code, they are also learning to break down complex problems into smaller, manageable parts. This analytical thinking is beneficial in various aspects of life and future professions.

          Additionally, coding fosters perseverance and resilience, as kids learn to troubleshoot and correct their errors. In an increasingly tech-driven world, coding literacy is as essential as traditional literacy. It opens doors to numerous career opportunities in various sectors, ensuring that children are equipped with the skills to succeed in a rapidly evolving job market. Moreover, early exposure to coding encourages inclusivity in the tech industry, breaking down barriers and stereotypes from a young age.

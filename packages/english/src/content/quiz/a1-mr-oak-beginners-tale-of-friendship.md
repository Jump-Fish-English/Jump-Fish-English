Once there was a big tree in a small park. Every day, children played under the tree. The tree liked to watch them. But the tree was sad because it had no name.

One sunny day, a little boy named Ben came to the park. Ben saw the tree. He touched the tree and said, "You are big and strong. I will call you Mr. Oak."

Mr. Oak felt happy. He had a name! Every day, Ben came to the park. Ben read books under Mr. Oak. He ate lunch with Mr. Oak. They became good friends.

The seasons changed. Leaves fell. Snow came. Ben wore a coat. He still came to see Mr. Oak. Mr. Oak waited for Ben every day.

One day, Ben did not come. Mr. Oak was worried. The next day, Ben came with a surprise. He had a small tree with him. "Mr. Oak, meet Little Pine," said Ben.

Now, Mr. Oak was not alone. He had Little Pine. The park was full of life again. Mr. Oak, Little Pine, and Ben were happy together. The end.
